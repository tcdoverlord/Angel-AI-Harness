# Angel Platform

> **"Peace Be The Journey" — Callan Palmer**

**Angel Platform** is a local-first AI assistant and system-management foundation built by **TCDOVERLORD**. It combines conversational AI, local intelligence, project and module tooling, controlled system workflows, persistent local data, and a browser-based interface.

The project is intended to be useful to individuals, students, researchers, hobbyists, developers, and organizations that want to explore or build on a locally controlled AI platform.

> **Current release:** Angel Platform 3.3.5  
> **Repository:** https://github.com/tcdoverlord/Angel-AI

---

## Project Goals

Angel Platform is designed around these principles:

- **Local-first operation** with local files and optional local AI inference.
- **Human approval before sensitive actions.**
- **Clear separation between conversation, planning, and execution.**
- **Auditable workflows** where practical.
- **Modular architecture** that can grow over time.
- **Accessible development** for learners, contributors, and independent builders.
- **Responsible collaboration** with individuals, organizations, and businesses.

Angel Platform is an evolving project. Some capabilities are implemented, some are limited, and others remain planned. Always verify the actual behavior of the version you are running.

---

## Main Components

### Angel AI

The conversational and intelligence layer supports:

- General conversation and explanations.
- Technical assistance and troubleshooting.
- Planning and creative work.
- Local knowledge and intelligence resources.
- Local memory and conversation-related storage.
- Optional integration with local AI providers such as Ollama.

### Angel Nexus

The management and integration layer is intended to provide:

- System and environment information.
- Tool and module discovery.
- Project-related workflows.
- Controlled script and module execution.
- Approval checks for potentially sensitive actions.
- Future integrations with additional system tools and services.

### Angel Platform OS

Angel Platform OS is the longer-term platform vision for connecting Angel AI and Angel Nexus with a personalized, modular computing environment.

This is a continuing development direction and should not be interpreted as a fully completed operating system or unrestricted system-control layer.

---

## Current Capabilities

The 3.3.x development line includes foundations for:

- Browser-based local interface.
- Optional desktop window through `pywebview`.
- Local HTTP server.
- Local project and module management.
- Controlled action definitions with confirmation requirements.
- Knowledge and case-study resources.
- Local SQLite intelligence storage.
- Compatibility JSON history and recovery data.
- Local logging and audit-oriented structures.
- Provider-backed weather functionality in the relevant development checkpoint.
- Windows executable packaging through PyInstaller.

Capabilities can vary by platform and configuration. Features that interact with the operating system should be reviewed and tested before use.

---

## System Requirements

### Windows

Recommended:

- Windows 10 or Windows 11, 64-bit.
- Python 3.10 or newer.
- PowerShell.
- Internet access for installing Python packages and optional services.
- Ollama, if local AI inference is enabled.

### Linux

Basic source execution may be possible on Linux, but platform-specific behavior and system integrations must be tested on the target distribution.

Windows executable packaging is not intended to be used as the Linux launch method.

---

## Installation from Source

### Windows

Open PowerShell in the repository directory:

```powershell
Set-Location "C:\Path\To\Angel-AI"
```

Create a virtual environment:

```powershell
py -3 -m venv .venv
```

If the Python launcher is unavailable:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
```

Install dependencies:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run a source validation check:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m compileall -q angel_platform run_angel_platform.py
```

Start Angel Platform:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -u .\run_angel_platform.py
```

The local interface normally uses:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765/
```

Keep the PowerShell window open while running from source so that startup errors and logs can be reviewed.

### Linux

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Validate the source:

```bash
python -m compileall -q angel_platform run_angel_platform.py
```

Start the application:

```bash
python -u ./run_angel_platform.py
```

---

## Optional Ollama Setup

Angel Platform can use local AI through Ollama when the relevant integration is enabled and configured.

Install Ollama from its official website:

```text
https://ollama.com/
```

Verify the installation:

```powershell
ollama --version
ollama list
```

If your configuration uses the example model from the development checkpoint:

```powershell
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
```

Test Ollama independently before troubleshooting Angel Platform:

```powershell
ollama run llama3.2:3b
```

Model names and integration behavior may change. Confirm the model configured by the application matches the model installed on your system.

---

## Windows Executable Build

The repository may include a Windows build script and PyInstaller specification.

Before building:

1. Verify that source mode starts successfully.
2. Back up any working `build` or `dist` directories.
3. Review the build script before running it.
4. Confirm that you trust every script being executed.

Build command:

```powershell
.\build_windows_exe.bat
```

The packaged application is expected to be an **onedir** build when generated through the documented packaging process. Keep the complete output directory together rather than copying only the executable.

Typical output:

```text
dist\AngelPlatform\AngelPlatform.exe
```

Build scripts may remove and recreate `build` and `dist`. Do not run them without backing up any package you need to preserve.

---

## Safety and Permission Model

Angel Platform is designed to keep users in control.

System-related actions should follow these principles:

- Explain the proposed action before execution.
- Request clear permission for sensitive or system-changing operations.
- Avoid unrestricted administrator access.
- Separate read-only inspection from modification.
- Make command output and errors visible.
- Distinguish between a proposed action and a completed action.
- Encourage backups before changes to important files or configurations.
- Never assume that AI-generated commands are safe or correct.

**Do not run unfamiliar scripts with administrator privileges unless you have reviewed and understood them.**

---

## Local Data and Privacy

Angel Platform may create local application data under:

```text
~/Angel_Platform
```

Depending on the installed version and enabled features, local data may include:

- Logs.
- SQLite intelligence data.
- Conversation or history compatibility files.
- Approved memories.
- Feedback records.
- Tool audit records.
- Recovery information.

Review the source and configuration before using Angel Platform with sensitive information. Protect local files, backups, credentials, tokens, and encryption material.

Do not commit private runtime data to GitHub.

---

## Development Workflow

Recommended workflow:

1. Inspect the existing implementation.
2. Explain the intended change.
3. Back up important files.
4. Make one controlled change.
5. Run syntax and validation checks.
6. Test the actual interface.
7. Review logs and errors.
8. Document the result.
9. Submit a focused contribution or pull request.

Useful checks:

```powershell
python -m py_compile .\angel_platform\webui\server.py
python -m compileall -q angel_platform run_angel_platform.py
git status
git diff --stat
git diff --cached --name-status
```
