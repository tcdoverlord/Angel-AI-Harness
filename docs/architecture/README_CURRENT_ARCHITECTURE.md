## 1. Architecture Purpose

Angel Platform is a local-first AI assistant and system-management platform.

The current architecture combines:

- A Python application launcher
- A local HTTP server
- A browser-based Angel Platform interface
- An optional pywebview desktop shell
- Local Ollama inference
- Deterministic application routes
- Angel Nexus monitoring and dashboard elements
- Projects, modules, system tools, DevOps, and memory areas
- Provider-backed live weather and forecast retrieval

The project is currently being developed through **Repair Mode**. Source code is edited and tested directly before the final Windows executable is rebuilt.

## 4. Application Startup Flow

### Source entry point

`run_angel_platform.py`

```python
from angel_platform.app import main

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Application launcher

`angel_platform/app.py`

Current responsibilities:

1. Import the server `run` function.
2. Start the server.
3. Run the server in a background thread.
4. Use `http://127.0.0.1:8765/` as the application URL.
5. Open a pywebview window sized for the Angel Platform interface.
6. Fall back to the system browser if pywebview is unavailable or fails.
7. Shut down the server when the application closes.

### Startup flow

```text
run_angel_platform.py
        |
        v
angel_platform.app.main()
        |
        v
server = run()
        |
        v
server.serve_forever() in background thread
        |
        v
pywebview opens http://127.0.0.1:8765/
        |
        v
Angel Platform UI becomes available
```

---

## 5. Repair Mode

Repair Mode is the current development method.

### Existing packaged mode

```text
RUN_WINDOWS.bat
        |
        v
dist\AngelPlatform\AngelPlatform.exe
```

### Source-based repair mode

```text
RUN_REPAIR_MODE.bat
        |
        v
python run_angel_platform.py
        |
        v
Current Python source is loaded
```

### Why Repair Mode is being used

Repair Mode allows the project to:

- Avoid rebuilding the executable after every change.
- Test changes through the real Angel Platform UI.
- See startup errors directly in PowerShell.
- Preserve the existing packaged executable.
- Iterate on features before final packaging.

### Repair cycle

```text
Inspect source
      |
      v
Back up the target file
      |
      v
Make one controlled change
      |
      v
Run syntax validation
      |
      v
Restart Repair Mode
      |
      v
Test through the UI
      |
      v
Document the result
```

---

## 6. Request Routing Architecture

The main chat endpoint is:

```text
POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/chat
```

The request contains values such as:

```json
{
  "message": "User request",
  "model": "llama3.2:3b",
  "history": [],
  "location": null
}
```

The server currently uses a routing pattern that separates verified application actions from ordinary model conversation.

### General routing sequence

```text
Incoming /api/chat request
        |
        v
Read message, model, history, and location
        |
        v
Select AI lane / request type
        |
        v
Check deterministic application routes
        |
        +--> Approval-related route
        |
        +--> GitHub-related route
        |
        +--> Windows diagnostic route
        |
        +--> Combined date/time and weather
        |
        +--> Tomorrow weather forecast
        |
        +--> Current weather
        |
        +--> Current date/time
        |
        `--> Ollama conversation fallback
```

The exact route order should be inspected before future modifications because route order can affect which handler receives a request.

---

## 7. Current Weather Architecture

### Current weather responsibilities

The current weather handler:

- Detects a weather-related request.
- Searches the user's message for a location after terms such as `in`, `near`, or `for`.
- Accepts approved device coordinates when supplied.
- Geocodes named locations through Open-Meteo.
- Uses New York, NY when no location or device coordinates are available.
- Requests current weather data from Open-Meteo.
- Returns temperature, apparent temperature, conditions, humidity, wind, and observation time.

### Location resolution order

```text
Approved device coordinates?
        |
        +--> Yes: use coordinates
        |
        `--> No
              |
              v
Location explicitly included in message?
              |
              +--> Yes: geocode requested location
              |
              `--> No: use New York, NY
```

### Current weather provider flow

```text
User weather question
        |
        v
Extract location or use default
        |
        v
Open-Meteo geocoding API
        |
        v
Latitude and longitude
        |
        v
Open-Meteo forecast API
        |
        v
Current weather response
```

---

## 8. Tomorrow Forecast Architecture

A dedicated tomorrow forecast handler was added during this checkpoint.

### Forecast responsibilities

The tomorrow forecast handler:

- Detects weather-related requests containing `tomorrow`.
- Extracts an explicit location when present.
- Uses approved device coordinates when available.
- Defaults to New York, NY when no location is provided.
- Geocodes the location when necessary.
- Requests daily forecast data from Open-Meteo.
- Selects the next forecast day.
- Returns:
  - Forecast date
  - High temperature
  - Low temperature
  - Weather description
  - Precipitation probability
  - Maximum wind speed
  - Provider attribution

### Forecast flow

```text
User asks about tomorrow's weather
        |
        v
Tomorrow + weather intent detected
        |
        v
Resolve device location, explicit location, or default
        |
        v
Open-Meteo geocoding if needed
        |
        v
Request two days of daily forecast data
        |
        v
Select index 1 as tomorrow
        |
        v
Return verified forecast response
```

### Example supported prompts

```text
What is the weather going to be like tomorrow?
```

```text
What is the weather going to be like tomorrow in Beech Grove, Indiana 46107?
```

### Verified behavior

- Beech Grove, Indiana forecast worked through the API.
- Beech Grove, Indiana forecast worked through the Angel Platform UI.
- New York, NY default forecast worked through the Angel Platform UI.
- The temperature degree symbol displays correctly as `°F`.

---

## 9. Open-Meteo Integration

The current live weather integration uses Open-Meteo endpoints.

### Geocoding endpoint

```text
https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search
```

Used to resolve a named location into latitude and longitude.

### Forecast endpoint

```text
https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast
```

Used for current conditions and daily forecast data.

### Current weather fields

The current weather route requests values including:

```text
temperature_2m
relative_humidity_2m
apparent_temperature
weather_code
wind_speed_10m
```

### Daily forecast fields

The tomorrow forecast route requests values including:

```text
temperature_2m_max
temperature_2m_min
weather_code
precipitation_probability_max
wind_speed_10m_max
```

### Reliability rule

Live information should come from the provider-backed deterministic route whenever the request matches a supported live-information pattern.

Ollama should not be relied upon to invent current weather, forecast values, or live timestamps.

---

## 10. User Interface Architecture

The current Angel Platform UI includes:

- Angel Platform branding
- Dark visual theme with blue accents
- Just Chat area
- Local Ollama model selector
- ChatGPT, OpenRouter, and Custom options in the interface
- Projects navigation
- Modules navigation
- System Tools navigation
- DevOps navigation
- Memory navigation
- Settings navigation
- Conversation history
- Angel Nexus dashboard
- Live monitor area
- System health card
- Registered modules card
- AI engine status card
- Quick Actions
- Recent Activity
- Read-aloud controls
- Message copy controls
- Voice and attachment controls

The UI was visually verified in the Windows environment during Repair Mode testing.

---

## 11. Current AI and Conversation Design

### Just Chat

The current primary conversational interface is intended for:

- Normal conversation
- Questions and explanations
- Planning
- Creative work
- General assistant interaction
- Natural-language requests

### Planned Sys Chat

The intended Sys Chat lane is designed for:

- Windows administration
- Linux administration
- Troubleshooting
- Diagnostics
- Module discovery
- Script preparation
- Tool execution planning
- Approval-controlled actions
- Structured technical responses

### Design principle

The system should preserve a clear separation between:

```text
Normal conversation
```

and:

```text
System administration and executable actions
```

The deterministic route layer should handle verified application actions, while Ollama handles ordinary conversational responses when no deterministic route applies.

---

## 12. Safety and Execution Model

The current interface displays approval-related status, including:

```text
Execution: Approval required
```

The architecture should continue to use an approval-controlled approach for actions that can modify the system.

Recommended separation:

```text
Read-only inspection
        |
        v
Explain intended action
        |
        v
Request approval when required
        |
        v
Execute only approved action
        |
        v
Report result and errors honestly
```

No future feature should claim that an action succeeded before the underlying operation confirms success.

---

## 13. Validation and Testing

### Syntax validation

```powershell
python -m py_compile .\angel_platform\webui\server.py
```

The syntax check passed during this checkpoint.

### API validation

The `/api/chat` endpoint was tested on port `8765`.

Verified API behavior included:

- Current weather for Beech Grove, Indiana.
- Tomorrow forecast for Beech Grove, Indiana.
- Default tomorrow forecast for New York, NY.
- Correct Fahrenheit degree-symbol display.

### UI validation

The same forecast behavior was tested through the Windows Angel Platform interface in Repair Mode.

### Process and port checks

Port `8765` is the active development port. If startup exits immediately, inspect existing processes using:

```powershell
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8765 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

Identify a listening process with:

```powershell
Get-Process -Id <PID>
```

Only stop a process after confirming it belongs to the old Angel session or another process that can safely be closed.

## 14. Known Architecture Limitations

The following areas are not yet complete:

- Hourly forecast support.
- Severe weather alert integration.
- Natural-language forecast summaries.
- Readable date formatting.
- Better timezone presentation.
- Multi-day forecast handling.
- Stronger location context retention.
- More complete weather intent classification.
- Unit tests for location parsing.
- Structured provider-error logging.
- Full separation and dedicated UI behavior for Just Chat and Sys Chat.
- Final executable packaging after all repairs are complete.

The current architecture document describes the known and verified state. It should be updated whenever a structural change is confirmed.

---

## 15. Recommended Next Architecture Improvements

### Priority 1: Weather routing quality

- Add explicit intent functions for current weather, tomorrow weather, hourly weather, and multi-day weather.
- Prevent current-weather routing from intercepting tomorrow-forecast prompts.
- Improve location extraction for ZIP codes and city/state combinations.
- Format dates in a human-readable way.
- Add provider response validation.

### Priority 2: Conversation context

- Preserve the last confirmed location during the active conversation.
- Make context retention explicit and visible.
- Avoid silently reusing stale locations across unrelated conversations.
- Allow the user to override the current location naturally.

### Priority 3: Just Chat and Sys Chat

- Define separate UI lanes.
- Define separate system prompts.
- Share only the memory and project context that is appropriate.
- Keep system actions approval-controlled.
- Add clear status indicators for the active lane.

### Priority 4: Testing

- Add unit tests for intent detection.
- Add location extraction tests.
- Add provider response tests.
- Add route-order tests.
- Add UI smoke tests for common prompts.
- Add safe failure tests for unavailable providers.

---

## 16. Architecture Principles

1. **Local-first:** Prefer local services and local model inference where practical.
2. **Transparent:** Tell the user when information comes from a provider, model, or local application route.
3. **Deterministic when needed:** Use verified handlers for live data and system operations.
4. **Approval-controlled:** Require approval for actions that can change the system.
5. **Test-driven repair:** Make small changes and test each change.
6. **Preserve working builds:** Do not replace the packaged executable during Repair Mode.
7. **Honest failures:** Never claim an operation succeeded without confirmation.
8. **Modular growth:** Keep weather, diagnostics, modules, memory, and AI routing separable.
9. **User control:** Keep the user informed about location use, actions, and execution behavior.
10. **Document checkpoints:** Record the verified state before ending a work session.

## Document Status

This document reflects the current known architecture at the `v3.2.5-repair-weather-forecast` checkpoint.

It is an architecture snapshot, not a claim that every planned feature is complete.

## 3.3.6 Persistent User-Owned Module Storage

Angel resolves persistent user data from the current operating-system user with `Path.home() / "Angel_Platform"`. No Windows username is hard-coded. GitHub modules are stored under `Angel_Platform/modules/github_modules`, outside the application/source directory. New clones and prepared modules use this location. Existing catalog entries that point to older Angel source folders are migrated conservatively when possible; locked/conflicting legacy repositories are preserved and remain usable as a compatibility fallback.
